			<h1> <em>ONE AMAZING NIGHTMARE<br> By Anshita Gera</em> </h1>

			<p>A beautiful morning came with a weird warning,<br>
			A day to showcase her skills of performing;<br>
			With many choices, she had to choose one,<br> 
			To make the future wonderful, like none!!<br>
			Overthinking and researching,  she was bewildered. <br>
			Her creative supervision turned into blurred smog filtered.<br>
			All the pros and cons were not best fitted, <br>
			And the ray of hope wasn't even emitted. <br>
			Passing everyday the twenty four hour routine,<br>
			She remained only the perplexed teen.<br>
			<br>
			A dreadful night with a worst nightmare:<br>
			Her future was dim everywhere,<br>
			Taking loans and having life taking thought,<br>
			The bed of dried roses, she had caught!<br>
			Sweat came upon her and she came upon sweat.<br>
			Woke up, became silent and gave load on mindset.<br>
			Pondered what she actually wanted, with a cup of tea;<br>
			Enlightened that writing was her cup of tea! <br>
			Years have been passed, became a renowned writer, <br>
			That nightmare changed her life, she became much lighter!<br></p>
