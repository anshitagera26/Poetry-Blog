			<h1> <em>THEY TOO HAVE LIVES<br> By Anshita Gera</em> </h1>

			<p>Handworking colourful lives turning into grey ones,<br>
			Half smiles transforming into millions of tear crumbs!<br>
			Their soul wanting to have life's sparkle instead of dust,<br>
			They only got a magician who threw them out of disgust.<br>
			<br>
			Walking in the earth's never ending platform,<br>
			Carrying immense loads, it seems like a heavy thunderstorm!<br>
			Even if they have air for satisfaction of lungs,<br>
			How can they fill their empty tums?<br>
			Barely any food and money, but gazillion struggles.<br>
			Such low hopes, there came many covid-19 bubbles.<br>
			<br>
			Imagine- people trying to cover miles without any question. <br>
			Then resting in the railway track due to extreme exhaustion,<br>
			Having deep sleep, no ears to listen to the approaching sound,<br>
			Those fast rotating wheels crushing their bodies in metallic ground.<br>
			Oh, i wish i was there with limitless force, to stop Aurangabad's train,<br>
			And bring glitter to people's lives and relieve their pain.<br>
			<br>
			Even collision has a massive impact,<br>
			Wherein two hefty bodies get individually slapped.<br>
			Oh, i wish i was there with limitless force, to stop those trucks from crashing.<br>
			Many migrant workers were sleeping, and in another moment, vanishing. <br>
			The situation in UP's Auraiya was disheartening.<br>
			And for me, infinitely frightening.<br>
			<br>
			To all the migrant workers, I am with you,<br>
			And hopefully the world does not pass through.<br>
			You have my heart always and forever,<br>
			Indeed, your suffering was never blur!<br>
