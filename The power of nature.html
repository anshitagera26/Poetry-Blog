			<h1> <em>THE POWER OF NATURE <br> By Anshita Gera</em> </h1>
			
			<p>
			Once, my brain became galaxy's expanse, <br>
			And my heart had earthquake by circumstance. <br>
			When concurrently, my flooded eyes gazed upon room's artificial stars,<br>
			They took me behind my self- developed bars,<br>
			To my beautiful history of dusk till dawn,<br>
			And the scintillating sweetness of surroundings to dwell on.<br>
			<br>
			The cherry blossom, the bird of paradise,<br>
			The pinks, the purples and the yellows intensifies.<br>
			The blue waves combined with the golden thread of charm,<br>
			Oh lord, natural food, water and medicine on our palm. <br>
			Sitting on the rock, scrutinising the nature,<br>
			Admiring spirited seeds, trees and every creature.<br>
			<br>
			My brain, body and heart have become constant companions.<br>
			I am now a shooting star, looking for constellations.<br>
			No longer dejected, but cheerful like a rainbow,<br>
			To all those in affliction: Go with the nature's eternal flow!<br>
			Go with the nature's eternal flow! <br> <br>
